# UART echo blocking

This example application demonstrates how to use the UART peripheral to transfer a block of data in a blocking manner.

## Description

This example shows the read and write operation over a UART in a blocking manner. The CPU polls the peripheral register continuously to manage the transfer. It receives a line of characters from the terminal window and echoes them back.

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with FPU (EF) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320007)

- Connect mini USB cables from the ‘Debug USB’ and ‘USB-to-UART’ connectors on the board to the computer

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. See the following message in the console:

    ![output](images/output_uart_echo_blocking.png)

5. Type a line of characters and press the Enter key
6. Entered line will be echoed back and the LED is toggled
